# JyniperGyms

## Description
JyniperGyms is an intuitive web application designed to simplify your gym experience. This project is part of an HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) class to demonstrate user-centric design and development principles.
## Investigation
During the investigation phase, we conducted thorough research to understand the features that our target users desire. Utilizing IDEO's human-centered design methodology, we engaged in user interviews, surveys, and observational studies. This approach allowed us to gather in-depth insights and preferences directly from potential users. Below are some of the most significant pieces of feedback we received:

## Paper Prototype
In the initial design phase, we created detailed paper sketches that served as the foundation for the website's user interface. These sketches allowed us to visualize and iterate on our ideas quickly before moving into digital prototyping. Here are the initial paper sketches that guided the creation of the website's design:
