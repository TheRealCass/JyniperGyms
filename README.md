To run the website, open and extract the zip folder,
go to the "pages" folder and click and open index.html. 

Note: 
- We are using some animations from bootstrap and lottie that may or may
 not appear when you open the website manually (that is, you open the html straight away without visual studio code and live server). To be able to see the animations, 
 please use Microsoft Visual Studio Code with the extension "Live Server". 
 After installing the Live Server extension, go to your visual studio code, right click on index.html and click "Open with Live server".
